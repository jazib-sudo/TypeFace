step1:
The most efficient way will be to create a data storage table, using Postman or ApacheJmeter like this:

user_id req_in reply_out 		 	resp 	 sum_resp_time 	 no_of_reqs 
0   	5			10    			5        5            		1
1 		5,20,25		10,23,33    	5,3,8    16            		3
2
.
.
.
1000

where,
user_id: A unique id for each user
req_in: Timestamp a request came in for the user
reply_out: At which time stamp response was provided
resp: Burst time(reply_out-req_in);i.e; difference in request timestamps and reply time stamp
sum_resp_time: cumulative response time(a running sum of resp)
no_of_reqs: A running record of requests.


And two variables:
total_sum_resp_time = whenever a response is provided, save it's duration(cumulative resp).
total_no_resp_time = cumulative A running record of requests


APIs
API1: total_sum_resp_time/total_no_resp_time
ApI2(user_id): this api asks for userid: generates sum_resp_time/no_of_reqs for given user id.

eg: API2(1) will give 16/3=5.33
